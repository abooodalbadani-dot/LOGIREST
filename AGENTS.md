# PROTOCOL — GRAPHIFY-DRIVEN NAVIGATION (TOKEN OPTIMIZATION)

This repository has been mapped using Graphify to optimize context windows and prevent token bleeding. 

Before searching the codebase, requesting file contents, or tracing a workflow, you MUST:
1. Consult `GRAPH_REPORT.md` to understand the system's architectural hubs and "God Nodes".
2. Query `graph.json` to trace exact dependencies, imports, and component relationships.

CRITICAL RULE:
- Do NOT perform blind recursive directory searches.
- Do NOT guess file paths or rely on your training data for Next.js/NestJS file structures.
- Resolve file locations and dependency chains through the Graphify map FIRST, then explicitly read ONLY the specific files necessary for the task.

# CRITICAL RULES - MUST FOLLOW

## RESPONSES

- Keep responses concise and to the point - unless the user asks otherwise

## PLANNING MODE

- Always ask clarifying questions
- Never assume design, tech stack or features
- Use deep-dive sub-agents to assist with research
- Use deep-dive sub-agents to review the different aspects of your plan before presenting to the user

## CHANGE / EDIT MODE

- Never implement features yourself when possible - use sub-agents!
- Identify changes from the plan that can be implemented in parallel, and use sub-agents to implement the features efficiently
- When using sub-agents to implement features, act as a coordinator only
- Use the best model for the task - premium models for complex tasks (like coding) and mid-tier models for simpler tasks, like documentation
- After completing features (large or small), always run commands like lint, type check and next build to check code quality
<!--
## DATABASE SCHEMA CHANGES

- Whenever you make changes to the database schema, ALWAYS run the drizzle generate and migrate commands
- NEVER run drizzle push!
-->

## TESTING

- Use any testing tools, libraries available to the project for testing your changes
- Never assume your changes simply work, always test!
- If the project does not have any testing tools, scripts, MCP tools, skills, etc. available for testing, ask the user whether testing should be skipped.

## UI DESIGN

- Always follow the UI design system when creating or reviewing components or pages.
- Design System: @DESIGN.md , E:\Kitchen‑Store Inventory System\.impeccable\design.json

## DATA INTEGRITY & STATE
- NEVER mutate database records directly. Always follow the state machine transitions defined in the project.
- ALWAYS respect the Optimistic Locking mechanism (`version` field) in Prisma updates to prevent concurrency bugs.
 
 ## MONOREPO ARCHITECTURE
- Strictly separate concerns. Do NOT mix Backend logic (NestJS/Prisma) inside Frontend components (Next.js).
- ALWAYS place shared types and Zod schemas in `packages/shared-types` and import them in both apps.

# InsForge SDK Documentation - Overview

## What is InsForge?

Backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform providing:

- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostgREST API
- **Authentication**: Email/password + OAuth (Google, GitHub)
- **Storage**: File upload/download
- **AI**: OpenRouter key provisioning and model catalog for direct OpenAI-compatible integrations
- **Functions**: Serverless function deployment
- **Realtime**: WebSocket pub/sub (database + client events)

## Installation

The following is a step-by-step guide to installing and using the InsForge TypeScript SDK for Web applications. If you are building other types of applications, please refer to:
- [Swift SDK documentation](/sdks/swift/overview) for iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS applications.
- [Kotlin SDK documentation](/sdks/kotlin/overview) for Android applications.
- [REST API documentation](/sdks/rest/overview) for direct HTTP API access.

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Follow these steps in order

### Step 1: Download Template

Use the `download-template` MCP tool to create a new project with your backend URL and anon key pre-configured.

### Step 2: Install SDK

```bash
npm install @insforge/sdk@latest
```

### Step 3: Create SDK Client

You must create a client instance using `createClient()` with your base URL and anon key:

```javascript
import { createClient } from '@insforge/sdk';

const client = createClient({
  baseUrl: 'https://your-app.region.insforge.app',  // Your InsForge backend URL
  anonKey: 'your-anon-key-here'       // Get this from backend metadata
});

```

**API BASE URL**: Your API base URL is `https://your-app.region.insforge.app`.

## Getting Detailed Documentation

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Always Fetch Documentation Before Writing Code

InsForge provides official SDKs and REST APIs, use them to interact with InsForge services from your application code.

- [TypeScript SDK](/sdks/typescript/overview) - JavaScript/TypeScript
- [Swift SDK](/sdks/swift/overview) - iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS
- [Kotlin SDK](/sdks/kotlin/overview) - Android and Kotlin Multiplatform
- [REST API](/sdks/rest/overview) - Direct HTTP API access

Before writing or editing any InsForge integration code, you **MUST** call the `fetch-docs` or `fetch-sdk-docs` MCP tool to get the latest SDK documentation. This ensures you have accurate, up-to-date implementation patterns.

### Use the InsForge `fetch-docs` MCP tool to get specific SDK documentation:

Available documentation types:

- `"instructions"` - Essential backend setup (START HERE)
- `"real-time"` - Real-time pub/sub (database + client events) via WebSockets
- `"db-sdk-typescript"` - Database operations with TypeScript SDK
- **Authentication** - Choose based on implementation:
  - `"auth-sdk-typescript"` - TypeScript SDK methods for custom auth flows
  - `"auth-components-react"` - Pre-built auth UI for React+Vite (singlepage App)
  - `"auth-components-react-router"` - Pre-built auth UI for React(Vite+React Router) (Multipage App)
  - `"auth-components-nextjs"` - Pre-built auth UI for Nextjs (SSR App)
- `"storage-sdk"` - File storage operations
- `"functions-sdk"` - Serverless functions invocation
- `"ai-integration-sdk"` - AI integration with the provisioned OpenRouter key and OpenAI SDK
- `"real-time"` - Real-time pub/sub (database + client events) via WebSockets
- `"deployment"` - Deploy frontend applications via MCP tool

These documentations are mostly for TypeScript SDK. For other languages, you can also use `fetch-sdk-docs` mcp tool to get specific documentation.

### Use the InsForge `fetch-sdk-docs` MCP tool to get specific SDK documentation

You can fetch sdk documentation using the `fetch-sdk-docs` MCP tool with specific feature type and language.

Available feature types:
- db - Database operations
- storage - File storage operations
- functions - Serverless functions invocation
- auth - User authentication
- ai - AI integration with the provisioned OpenRouter key and OpenAI SDK
- realtime - Real-time pub/sub (database + client events) via WebSockets

Available languages:
- typescript - JavaScript/TypeScript SDK
- swift - Swift SDK (for iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS)
- kotlin - Kotlin SDK (for Android and JVM applications)
- rest-api - REST API

## When to Use SDK vs MCP Tools

### Always SDK for Application Logic:

- Authentication (register, login, logout, profiles)
- Database CRUD (select, insert, update, delete)
- Storage operations (upload, download files)
- AI integration via the provisioned OpenRouter key with the OpenAI SDK or OpenRouter HTTP API
- Serverless function invocation

### Use MCP Tools for Infrastructure:

- Project scaffolding (`download-template`) - Download starter templates with InsForge integration
- Backend setup and metadata (`get-backend-metadata`)
- Database schema management (`run-raw-sql`, `get-table-schema`)
- Storage bucket creation (`create-bucket`, `list-buckets`, `delete-bucket`)
- Serverless function deployment (`create-function`, `update-function`, `delete-function`)
- Frontend deployment (`create-deployment`) - Deploy frontend apps to InsForge hosting

## Important Notes

- For auth: use `auth-sdk` for custom UI, or framework-specific components for pre-built UI
- SDK returns `{data, error}` structure for all operations
- Database inserts require array format: `[{...}]`
- Serverless functions have single endpoint (no subpaths)
- Storage: Upload files to buckets, store URLs in database
- AI integrations should call OpenRouter directly with `baseURL: "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"` and a server-side `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- **EXTRA IMPORTANT**: Use Tailwind CSS 3.4 (do not upgrade to v4). Lock these dependencies in `package.json`
